# Mili – What the Ripple Sees

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I saw your eyes
Wish I was there
To give you the embrace that you deserve
I saw a light
A shiny tear
The end you seeked, does it bring you to peace?
If only you can see, your histories remain in me
A signal sprouting
A signal growing
A signal blooming
I walk through the path
Fingertips pollinating
The flowers spreading
The flowers singing
The flowers watching
Someday I hope to see you here
Far far away, countless light-years
No need to hurry, my dear
And if you're lost in disbelief, I'll sit beside
you quietly
I'll hold your hand squeezing tightly
And let your tears dampen my sleeve
By the time you are calm, I am no where to be
found
As if I was never around
And if you're screaming silently, I'll kiss away
the uncertainty
I'll rock you gently in my arms until you're
asleep
In your dreams I disappeared
A ripple of floral scent lingers
Then I saw a world
Conflicting views
Friction between the hearts
I saw a war
Once living corpse
A rotten truth
A fuel to your fires
Tiny wavelengths
A ripple crying
A ripple smiling
A ripple longing
Someday I hope to see you here
Far far away, countless light-years
As long as you truly desire
Goodbye, goodbye
Please don't miss me
You'll be alright
Do not worry
Sometimes I'm nowhere
Sometimes I'm everywhere
Not too far nor too near
And if you look down to your feet, I'm waving at
you secretly
A shadow of you, a shadow of me
Walking side by side steadily
By the time you are strong, I am no where to be
found
As if I was never around
And if your world is on repeat, I'll love each
version of you the same
Hoping one day your lives can be perfectly
mundane
Even in a million years
My ripples flow wherever you go
